# Ecig-Sleep-Project
This project investigates the association between e-cigarette use and inadequate sleep (<7 hours per night) using complex survey data and SAS programming. The analysis is based on a BRFSS-like dataset and employs PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC to account for survey weights, stratification, and clustering. The project includes data cleaning, recoding, descriptive statistics, and both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models.

🔧 Tools Used:
SAS (Statistical Analysis System)

Complex Survey Procedures: PROC SURVEYFREQ, PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC

Public Health Dataset (structured like BRFSS)

🔍 Research Objective:
To examine whether e-cigarette use is independently associated with increased odds of inadequate sleep after adjusting for demographic and behavioral confounders.
